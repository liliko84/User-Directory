# User-Directory

On this directory the user can view the entire employee directory at once they can  have access to their information.

There is a table of random users when the page loads, with the photo, first and last names , email adresses.

We are able to filter the user by the names and sort their informatiom by the first and last name.

All those functionalities are given in the src folder and App.js file which we start with importing react component and greating the employee aray. When the page load with the random user Api we will get the json data of users as a result.

Then we are creating a function to filter employees by first and last name by searching the information in the search box.

After filter we sort the employees also by first and last name by clicking on the buttons. 

On the main page we are getting the email, phone number and adress of the employees together with the first and last names.
